        <h4>Hey there! I’m an aspiring web developer who’s just dipped my toes into the world of coding. 
            Currently based in India, I’m on an exciting journey to learn and create. 
            <br />
            <br />
            My focus right now is HTML—the backbone of web pages. 
            I’m fascinated by how a few tags can transform plain text into a structured layout. 
            <br />
            <br />
            As I explore HTML, I’m already dreaming about the websites I’ll build! 
            When I’m not typing out tags, I’m probably sipping chai and reading beginner-friendly tutorials. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I’m eager to dive into CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) soon. 
            The idea of making buttons change color or creating a simple animation gets me pumped! 
            <br />
            <br />
            Feel free to follow my progress and view some of my basic projects. I’ll be sharing my coding adventures on this portfolio. 
            Let’s connect and learn together!</h4>
